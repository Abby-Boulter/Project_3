<span style="font-size:14px;"><strong> During the Arizona summer, heat impacts health and well-being. Heat-related illness (HRI) includes heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Within the United States, 700 heat-related deaths occur yearly. These deaths are preventable, and we can decrease these numbers by spreading awareness. And while there is no Federal mandate on reporting heat-related illness, it is up to state and local health departments to monitor. </strong></span>
