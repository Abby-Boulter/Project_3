## Background
Within the United States, 700 heat-related deaths occur yearly. These deaths are preventable, and we can decrease these numbers by spreading awareness. And while there is no Federal mandate on reporting heat-related illness, it is up to state and local health departments to monitor. And the data from these departments are usually difficult to access or navigate for the public. Our team aims to provide a dashboard linking health data to clear visualizations that the public can use.
Using the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network and the Arizona Department of Health Services Tracking data, we should be able to make a dashboard to help prevent heat-related illness. We will examine the relations among heat-related illness ED visits throughout the past decade, high daily temperatures, social vulnerability index, and other possibilities derived from the data.

## Questions
* Is there a range of temperatures that we see an increase in HRI mortality?
* Do we see a correlation between the social vulnerability index and HRI ED visits? 
* Which counties are heavily impacted by HRI?
