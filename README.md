## Overview
Within the United States, 700 heat-related deaths occur yearly. These deaths are preventable, and we can decrease these numbers by spreading awareness. Our team aims to provide a dashboard linking health data to clear visualizations that the public can use. Using the Arizona Department of Health Services Environmental Health Tracking data, we created a dashboard to provide public acccess to heat-related illness data. We examined the relations among heat-related illness ED visits throughout the past decade, high daily temperatures, social vulnerability index, and other possibilities derived from the data.

### Requirements
1.	Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
2.	Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:
    * A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
    * A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
    * A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
3.	Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4.	Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
5.	Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
6.	Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
